## 🕰️ What Happened in 1930–1945?

This period marked a **major global transformation**, shaped by:

- **The Great Depression (1929–1939)**:  
  A massive collapse in global output, soaring U.S. unemployment (up to 25%), and long-term economic stagnation.

- **The New Deal**:  
  U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt launched public works, social security, and financial reforms to recover growth.

- **World War II Mobilization (1939–1945)**:  
  War-driven industrial demand revitalized economies and erased unemployment.

- **Global Order Reset (1944–1945)**:  
  The Bretton Woods system and institutions like the IMF and World Bank were created, ushering in a U.S.-led financial era.

## ✅ Why Ray Dalio Says "Today Feels Like the 1930s"

According to Dalio, the current moment reflects **the late stage of a long-term debt cycle**, with these parallels:

- **Record-high debt** in governments and corporations  
- **Internal conflict**: rising inequality and polarization  
- **External geopolitical stress**: China-U.S. tensions, regional wars  
- **Declining trust in fiat currencies** and traditional institutions

In Dalio’s view, these signals mirror the chaos of the 1930s and foreshadow a coming global realignment.

## 🧭 Macro Outlook: My View as a Founder + Investor

We are living through **a convergence of multiple cycles**:

1. **End of a Long-Term Debt Cycle (80–100 years)**  
2. **Geopolitical restructuring** similar to the 1930s  
3. **Midpoint of a 50–60 year tech supercycle** (1970–2050), now powered by AI

> My prediction: Turbulence is inevitable, but **technology will reset the global growth engine**.  
> A new economic and power structure will emerge by **2035**.

## 🧠 The Role of Technology in Economic Cycles

### 1. Tech isn’t a cushion—it’s a reset button

| Era           | Tech Breakthrough     | Impact                                   |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1930–1950s     | Electrification        | Industrial boom & mass consumption       |
| 1970–1990s     | Microprocessors, PCs   | Rise of the information economy          |
| 2020–2035*     | AI, LLMs, Automation   | Cognitive labor revolution               |

AI is not just a tool—it’s the **electricity of the brain**, replacing or enhancing white-collar jobs like lawyers, engineers, and consultants.

### 2. K-Shaped Recovery & Social Reset

- Those **leveraging AI tools** will grow exponentially  
- Those without access or skills risk **structural unemployment**  
- Massive capital concentration will continue (e.g., OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic backed by billions)

## 📈 Where I'm Investing

### 🌱 What Industries?

- **AI infrastructure & vertical applications**  
- **Smart manufacturing & robotics**  
- **Bio-AI (e.g., protein folding, genetic engineering)**  
- **Clean energy systems & renewables**

### 🏢 What Kind of Companies?

- **Early-stage teams** with traction & speed  
- **Cash-efficient models** that can weather macro volatility  
- **Anti-fragile business logic**, aligned with global reshoring & inflation hedges

## 🚶 How Can Ordinary People Ride the Wave?

1. **Stop chasing trends—study structural logic**  
   Understand how tech *reshapes* entire industries, not just how it “adds efficiency.”

2. **Build skill-backed capital**  
   AI tools are the lowest-risk, highest-leverage investment in your future.

3. **Create sustainable side projects**  
   A cash-generating digital product or service offers cushion and optionality.

4. **Simplify your lifestyle + increase your cash buffer**  
   Volatility is the new normal. Preserve decision flexibility by minimizing fixed costs.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

> "Every time a major cycle ends, the world looks like it's collapsing.  
> Every time a tech revolution begins, it looks like a fringe game."

Right now, **we stand at both thresholds**.

If you can ignore the noise and build for the future, this may be the **single best moment in your life** to start something meaningful.

If you wait for things to return to “normal,” you’ll miss the very reset that redefines the next 50 years.
