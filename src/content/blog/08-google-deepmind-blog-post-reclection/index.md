Recently, I read an interview with Seong-Hyun Hwang, former Head of HR at Google Brain and now CEO of Quantum Insight. His research into why Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) professionals rarely rise to executive roles in Silicon Valley hit close to home—especially as an AI founder with a technical background navigating both startup building and cross-cultural leadership.

### The “Cultural Code” That Holds East Asians Back

Despite dominating engineering orgs, East Asians are underrepresented at the leadership level in tech. Hwang outlined **three core cultural habits** that explain why:

1. **Deference to Authority**  
   Many CJK professionals grow up learning to "follow instructions" and deliver results—not challenge the system. But in fast-growth environments like startups, leadership demands initiative, bold vision, and personal ownership, not just execution.

2. **Relationship Building Gaps**  
   Western corporate culture tends to value *warmth before competence*. East Asians are often perceived as cold or distant, even when they’re highly capable—this unintentional image makes it harder to be seen as leadership material.

3. **Avoiding Vulnerability**  
   “Saving face” prevents many from showing weakness or asking for help. But in a world where innovation depends on feedback, transparency, and iteration, hiding uncertainty is a silent career killer.

### My Reflection as a Founder

As someone who’s built AI products from computer vision systems to mobile coaching apps, I’ve experienced firsthand the tension between **engineering excellence and leadership adaptability**.

I've met the "10x developers"—people whose coding or memory speed is inhuman. But I’ve also seen how those same individuals struggle with insomnia, emotions, or collaboration. These people need a tailored environment—not a standard performance model. I think about this often as I design teams and build culture around not just productivity, but **sustainable excellence**.

I’ve also been fortunate. My upbringing combined **open-minded East Asian values** with **Western educational freedom**. Studying abroad, surviving hardship, and building companies in cross-cultural contexts gave me resilience and perspective. These are my privileges, and I own them.

### What It Means for Other Founders & Investors

If you're a founder like me:

- **You’re not here to be perfect.** You’re here to be real, adaptive, and resilient.
- **Your superpower isn’t just tech—it’s your ability to learn, lead, and build trust.**
- **Being vulnerable isn’t weak.** It’s the foundation of innovation and honest collaboration.

If you’re an investor:

- **Look beyond polish.** Some of the strongest founders don’t look or act like a typical pitch deck.
- **Support culturally diverse leadership.** The talent is there—it just needs a platform and mentorship that fits.

### Final Thoughts: Dream Bigger

Hwang ended the interview with a call for younger generations to dream more boldly. I echo that. Especially in AI, where tools are powerful but narratives shape reality.

**So here’s my message to fellow founders:**
Don’t shrink to fit an old mold. Be the kind of founder you never had growing up. Build something that not only works—but matters.

Let your startup reflect your story, your resilience, and your vision.

And remember—*execution beats everything, but authenticity scales faster than code.*
