**July 22, 2025**

Yesterday, a friend asked me, *“Are you afraid of failure?”*

I paused. Before answering, I tried to define what failure means to me—*not* to others, but to myself. I realized I had never really thought about it before.

For me, failure isn’t about losing or falling behind. It’s about **stopping**—stopping the pursuit of what I love. And that hasn’t happened yet. If anything, I’ve **strategically shifted** goals, adjusted direction, but never truly quit.

Back to that moment—I opened my mouth to say, *“If…”*  
And I cried.

It hit me that somewhere deep inside, there's a fear not of failure itself, but of betraying what matters to me.

In the end, I still believe this: **what others think doesn’t matter.**  
You can be free if you choose to do what you love.

## 🔍 What is Failure? (In General)

### 1. Definition of Failure

At its core, **failure** is the lack of success in achieving a desired goal or outcome.

Psychologically, it's perceived as a personal shortcoming or a disruption of expectations.

But failure isn’t a fixed concept—it shifts across cultures, systems, and personal worldviews.

### 2. Psychological View of Failure

Failure often triggers emotions like shame, fear, disappointment, or grief. But it can also be:

- A **catalyst for learning**
- A **necessary stage** in skill development
- A **mirror** of our values and resilience

> Carol Dweck’s *Growth Mindset* research shows:  
> People who treat failure as feedback—rather than a verdict—are more likely to persist and ultimately succeed.

---

### 3. Cultural Perspectives on Failure

- **Western cultures** (U.S., Australia): Often celebrate "failing forward" and see risk-taking as a virtue.
- **Eastern cultures** (China, Japan): Tend to associate failure with shame or loss of face, placing more pressure on perfection—but this mindset is slowly evolving, especially among younger entrepreneurs.

## 🚀 What is Failure in Startups?

Startups operate in high-risk, high-uncertainty environments. Here, **failure isn’t unusual—it’s expected**.

---

### 1. Common Definitions in Startups

Startup failure often looks like:

- Running out of money (burn rate > revenue)
- Not achieving product-market fit
- Founders giving up or pivoting drastically
- Being unable to scale or attract users/investors

But deeper, more nuanced failures include:

- Failing to learn fast enough
- Solving a non-existent problem
- Building the wrong team
- Being ignored or outcompeted

---

### 2. Failure Rates

According to CB Insights:

- ~**90% of startups fail**, and the top reasons are:

| Reason                     | %   |
|---------------------------|-----|
| No market need            | 42% |
| Ran out of cash           | 29% |
| Not the right team        | 23% |
| Got outcompeted           | 19% |
| Pricing/cost issues       | 18% |

---

### 3. Reframing Startup Failure

Modern startup culture reframes failure as:

- **Data** → Every setback is a signal to iterate
- **Proof of action** → You tried, you shipped, you learned
- **Innovation fuel** → Most successful startups (Airbnb, Slack, Instagram) were born from pivots and missteps

> **Paul Graham (Y Combinator)** once said:  
> “The only way to not fail is to not try. And in startups, trying is everything.”

| Context      | Failure Means                                    | Deeper Interpretation                         |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| General Life | Not achieving a goal or ideal                    | An opportunity to reflect, reset, and realign |
| Psychology   | Emotional response to unmet expectations         | A tool for building grit and self-awareness   |
| Culture      | Shame (East) vs. Opportunity (West)              | Evolving toward acceptance and growth         |
| Startups     | No PMF, cash burnout, poor team/product decisions| Part of the iteration loop to eventual success|

## 💭 Closing Thoughts

Failure is messy, emotional, and often misunderstood.

But it doesn’t define you—**it refines you**.

Whether you’re an athlete, founder, artist, or student, the key is not to avoid failure, but to **fail wisely**, learn fast, and keep building what matters to you.

Your freedom begins the moment you stop fearing failure—and start creating anyway.

After learning what failure means in startups (no product-market fit) and in life (not achieving goals), I realized I’ve never been afraid of either.

Over the past 10 years, I’ve consistently achieved what I set out to do. Culturally, I used to carry the weight of Eastern expectations—but studying and working abroad for a decade has reshaped my mindset. I no longer carry shame as a default response.

Now, I stay grounded, keep expectations realistic, and focus on what really matters. I don’t rely on external validation—and I trust myself deeply.
I’ve learned that doing the work I love, with humility and intention, speaks louder than anything else.

Most of what I design resonates—even without paid marketing—and that’s because it comes from a place of purpose, not pressure.
